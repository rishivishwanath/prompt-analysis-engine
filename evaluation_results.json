{
  "clarity": {
    "score": 8,
    "reason": "The candidate's initial prompt was clear, but subsequent prompts lacked some precision, especially regarding the unexpected digit change.  The problem description was generally understandable."
  },
  "specificity": {
    "score": 7,
    "reason": "The candidate clearly stated the problem of appending instead of replacing input values. However, the later problem with the last digit being replaced was less clearly defined initially.  More precise error messages or examples would have improved specificity."
  },
  "context": {
    "score": 9,
    "reason": "The candidate provided sufficient context, including the code snippets, the expected and actual outputs, and the programming environment (Capybara).  This allowed the AI to understand the issue effectively."
  },
  "format": {
    "score": 8,
    "reason": "The candidate didn't explicitly specify an output format, but the implicit expectation was for code solutions and explanations. The AI correctly interpreted this."
  },
  "tone_persona": {
    "score": 7,
    "reason": "The tone was professional and polite. However, there was a slight lack of assertiveness in clarifying the unexpected digit change issue.  More direct phrasing could have improved the interaction."
  },
  "completeness": {
    "score": 8,
    "reason": "The candidate provided most of the necessary information.  However, the initial description of the unexpected digit change could have included more details about the environment and potential interfering factors."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "score": 7,
    "reason": "The prompts were generally concise, but some could have been more succinct.  For example, the description of the unexpected digit change could have been more focused."
  },
  "iteration_quality": {
    "score": 9,
    "reason": "The candidate effectively iterated on the prompts, providing more details and refining the problem description based on the AI's responses. They incorporated suggestions and explored different solutions."
  },
  "adaptation": {
    "score": 9,
    "reason": "The candidate adapted well to the AI's suggestions, trying different approaches and providing additional context as needed. They showed a good understanding of debugging techniques."
  },
  "follow_up_effectiveness": {
    "score": 8,
    "reason": "The candidate asked relevant clarifying questions, although some could have been more precise.  For example, directly asking about potential JavaScript interference would have been more effective."
  },
  "total_score": 76,
  "percentage_score": "76%",
  "overall_feedback": "The candidate demonstrates good prompting skills, showing an ability to clearly describe problems, provide context, and iterate on prompts based on AI responses.  Areas for improvement include increasing the precision and assertiveness in problem descriptions, and asking more targeted clarifying questions.  The candidate's debugging skills and ability to adapt to different solutions are commendable."
