{
  "clarity": {
    "score": 6.0,
    "reason": "While the prompts generally convey the user's issue, some lack precision.  For example, 'What's the reason for this?' is too vague.  Prompt 5 is clearer but could benefit from more structured formatting."
  },
  "specificity": {
    "score": 7.0,
    "reason": "The user specifies the problem (appending instead of replacing) and provides code examples. However, the problem description in prompt 3 is too general.  Prompt 5 is more specific, including expected and actual outputs."
  },
  "context": {
    "score": 6.0,
    "reason": "The user provides some context (code snippets, previous inputs) but could improve by consistently including relevant information from the start.  The context is piecemeal across multiple prompts."
  },
  "format": {
    "score": 4.0,
    "reason": "The user doesn't specify a desired output format.  The information is presented in a conversational style, which is acceptable for debugging but lacks structure for a more formal request."
  },
  "tone_persona": {
    "score": 8.0,
    "reason": "The tone is polite and problem-solving oriented. The user expresses frustration but does so constructively."
  },
  "completeness": {
    "score": 6.0,
    "reason": "The prompts are not entirely complete in isolation.  Information is spread across multiple prompts, requiring the reader to piece together the full context.  Prompt 5 is the most complete, but still lacks some background on the 'user_mobile_number' object."
  },
  "conciseness": {
    "score": 6.0,
    "reason": "The prompts could be more concise.  Some information is repeated across prompts.  The information in prompt 5 could be better organized."
  },
  "iteration_quality": {
    "score": 7.0,
    "reason": "The user iteratively refines the problem description and provides more context with each prompt.  The progression from a general problem to a specific example demonstrates good iterative thinking."
  },
  "adaptation": {
    "score": 6.0,
    "reason": "The user adapts their approach by providing more detailed code examples and expected/actual outputs as the conversation progresses. However, they could have started with a more complete and structured initial prompt."
  },
  "follow_up_effectiveness": {
    "score": 6.0,
    "reason": "The follow-up questions are relevant and help to clarify the problem.  Prompt 3 is a good example of a clarifying question, although it could be more specific."
  },
  "total_score": 63.0,
  "percentage_score": "63%",
  "overall_feedback": "The user demonstrates a reasonable ability to debug a problem iteratively. However, the prompts could be significantly improved by providing more complete and structured information from the outset.  More concise and specific language would also enhance clarity and efficiency.  Focusing on providing all necessary context in a single, well-formatted prompt would greatly improve the overall prompting skill.",
